Think about it. A transaction that costs $77 on ETH, is only $0.08 on cheapETH. Made possible by cheapgas.

The cheap eth gang solves the gas crisis.

* Imagine a 100% compatible car with your car that's 1000x cheaper. Or even a cup of coffee. You'll be living like a king in no time.

<b>How to get cheapETH</b>

If you had ETH in block 11818959, you have cheapETH! A 1 to 1 ratio of course.

You'll also be able to buy cheapETH in the crowd sale, 1 ETH for 1000 cheapETH.


Breakdown:
* 80% to existing ETH holders
* 10% in cheapETH crowdsale
* 10% held to fund maintaining and upgrading cheapETH and pay our developers


You can also mine cheapETH, just like normal eth. Except it's easier, because it's cheap.

<b>CheapETH market cap</b>

If ethereum has a market cap of $186 billion, cheapETH has a market cap of $186 million.

<hr>

<b>Why cheapETH?</b>

So aside from the fact that ETH is too expensive for normal people to use, cheapETH can serve many purposes.

Testnets suffer from this problem of valueless currency. You don't want valueless, since DDOS is free. Cheap is better than free

Testnets also lack a rich ecosystem of contracts. cheapETH also has cheapSNX, cheapDAI, and even cheapBAT. All is cheap on cheapETH.

<hr>

<b>Wait, how much is a cheapDAI worth?</b>

That's a great question. I see an argument for a tenth of a cent, and I also see an argument for $1.00. The market can decide!
