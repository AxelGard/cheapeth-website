You like ethereum? You wish you could use it, BUT TRANSACTIONS ARE 100 FUCKING DOLLARS?!?

You need cheapeth. It's 100% compatible with eth, except 1000x of the price (cheaper of course!).


Think about it. A transaction that costs $77 on ETH, is only $0.08 on cheapETH. Made possible by cheapgas.

The cheap eth gang solves the gas crisis.

<b>How to get cheapETH</b>

If you had ETH on 2/7/21, you have cheapETH! A 1 to 1 ratio of course.

You'll also be able to buy cheapETH in the crowd sale, 1 ETH for 1000 cheapETH.


Breakdown:
* 80% to existing ETH holders
* 10% in cheapETH crowdsale
* 10% held to fund maintaining and upgrading cheapETH and pay our developers


You can also mine cheapETH, just like normal eth. Except it's easier, because it's cheap.

<b>CheapETH market cap</b>

If ethereum has a market cap of $186 billion, cheapETH has a market cap of $186 million.
